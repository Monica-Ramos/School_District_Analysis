# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis: 
This project analyzes district school data regarding reading and math tests in order to get relevant insights about performance trends and oputputs. The analysis seeks to assist school board in making decisions regarding the school budget and priorities. The project consists in two analysis, the first one takes into account all of the avilable data. However the second analysis excludes the results of 9th grade students at Thomas High School as there are suspicions of academic disshonesty. Therefore the second analysis was run without taking into consideration the results of this group. The main deliverables for our client were a district summary and a school summary that contained all of the information needed for them to make informed decisions. In this report we are going to compare the results of the two analysis made (one with all students and the other excluding 9th grade High School students)
