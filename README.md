# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis: 

This project analyzes district school data regarding reading and math tests in order to get relevant insights about performance trends and oputputs. The analysis seeks to assist school board in making decisions regarding the school budget and priorities.

The project consists in two analysis, the first one takes into account all of the avilable data. However the second analysis excludes the results of 9th grade students at Thomas High School as there are suspicions of academic disshonesty. Therefore the second analysis was run without taking into consideration the results of this group.

The main deliverables for our client were a district summary and a school summary that contained all of the information needed for them to make informed decisions. In this report we are going to compare the results of the two analysis made (one with all students and the other excluding 9th grade High School students)



## Results: 

In this part of the analysis we will discuss the main results obtained from both analysis.

* How is the district summary affected?

The district summary shows the results of the math and reading tests performance of all the schools in the district as well as the total budget. 
The results from the first analysis are shown below:

The results from the second analysis are shown next:

From the previous images, we can conclude that the number of total students, schools and budget remained the same. This is because eventhough the second analysis does not take into account the results from 9th grade Thomas High Students in math and reading, they are still considered part of the school and do not affect the school budget as well. However it does affect math results as it decreases the average score from 79 to 78.9, and the % of passing math also decreases from 75% to 74.8%. Average reading score is unaffected, but the percentage of passing reading slightly decreased, from 85.8 % to 85.7%. Laslty, we can see that the overal percentage of passing also decreased from 65.2% to 64.9%.  In general, results show a very slight variation in the district performance but it still affects.

Math and reading scores by grade
Scores by school spending
Scores by school size
Scores by school type
